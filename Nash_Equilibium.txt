Nash Theorem that we can apply to this problem is for animal.

Animal can design what is the point for doing that action and then
compare with the other animal. If the point is higher than the other
animal, then the animal will prefer that action. If all of animal
prefer the same action, then that action is the best action for all of
the animal.

Pegion hole Theorem that we can apply to reproduce problem is for animal.

If there are 3 animal and 2 action, then there is at least 1 action
that is chosen by 2 animal if that 2 animal use reproduce action then
they will reproduce.

Oligopoly Theorem that we can apply to this problem is for animal food chain.

If there are a lot of carnivore animal, then the food chain will try to don't
eat the same animal type to avoid extinction and avoid competition but if there
are less herbivore animal, then carnivore animal will eat the same animal type
and kill other animal type to avoid extinction and avoid competition.
